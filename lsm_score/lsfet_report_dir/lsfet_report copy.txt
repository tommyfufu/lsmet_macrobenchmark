I. Introduction of Linux Security Module (LSM)
1. AppArmor
    Overview:
        AppArmor, Application Armor, is an application-centric MAC framework built using LSM. Apparmor confines individual programs to a set of files, 
        capabilities, network access and rlimits, collectively known as the AppArmor policy for the program, or simply as a profile.
    Application field:
        PC, Server
2. SELinux
    Overview:
        Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) a label-based MAC framework, that provides a hybrid of concepts and capabilities drawn from mandatory access controls, 
        mandatory integrity controls, role-based access control (RBAC), and type enforcement architecture. 
    Application field:
        Server, PC

3. Smack
    Overview:
        Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel (Smack) is a Linux kernel security module that protects data and process interaction from malicious manipulation 
        using a set of custom mandatory access control (MAC) rules, with simplicity as its main design goal. Framework of SMACK is a mix of DTE and Bell-La Padula.
    Application field:
        Embedded Operating System, IoT

4. TOMOYO Linux:
    Overview:
        TOMOYO Linux focuses on the behaviour of a system. Every process is created to achieve a purpose, and like an immigration officer, 
        TOMOYO Linux allows each process to declare behaviours and resources needed to achieve their purpose. When protection is enabled, 
        TOMOYO Linux acts like an operation watchdog, restricting each process to only the behaviours and resources allowed by the administrator.
    Application field:
        Router, OS for static behavier

II. Introduction of minor Linux Security Module
1. Capabilities
    The LSM kernel patch moves most of the existing POSIX.1e capabilities logic into an optional security module stored in the file security/capability.c. 
    This change allows users who do not want to use capabilities to omit this code entirely from their kernel, 
    instead using the dummy module for traditional superuser logic or any other module that they desire. 
    This change also allows the developers of the capabilities logic to maintain and enhance their code more freely, without needing to integrate patches back into the base kernel.
2. Lockdown

3. Yama
    Yama is a Linux Security Module that collects system-wide DAC security protections that are not handled by the core kernel itself. 
    This is selectable at build-time with CONFIG_SECURITY_YAMA, and can be controlled at run-time through sysctls in /proc/sys/kernel/yama
4. LoadPin
    LoadPin is a Linux Security Module that ensures all kernel-loaded files (modules, firmware, etc) all originate from the same filesystem, 
    with the expectation that such a filesystem is backed by a read-only device such as dm-verity or CDROM. 
    This allows systems that have a verified and/or unchangeable filesystem to enforce module and firmware loading restrictions without needing to sign the files individually.
5. SafeSetID
    SafeSetID is an LSM module that gates the setid family of syscalls to restrict UID/GID transitions from a given UID/GID to only those approved by a system-wide allowlist. 
    These restrictions also prohibit the given UIDs/GIDs from obtaining auxiliary privileges associated with CAP_SET{U/G}ID, such as allowing a user to set up user namespace UID/GID mappings.

III. Checking Distribution Environment
After lsfet_lsm_score testing, the_most_suitable LSM is SELinux
It's score is 24
And your Distribution Ubuntu's  default LSM is AppArmor
It's score is 10
Fortunately, your Distribution Ubuntu does insert SELinux into the kernel
So you don't need to remake a new kenerl

IV. Questionnaire analysis
Listing each test and your answer, and comparison of the differences between the most appropriate LSM and the default LSM based on your responses to 
the lsfet_lsm_score test

/----------------------------------------/
Class 1 - Trivial questions 
/----------------------------------------/
----------------------------------------
1. Want LSM has default policy? [T/F]
Description: LSM provides default policy
Your answer is: t
----------
the_most_suitable LSM SELinux does 
support and get 1 point
----------
The default LSM AppArmor does 
not supports
----------------------------------------
2. Want LSM to support Automatic policy? [T/F]
Description: LSM provides the ability to automatically generate policies (i.e. learning mode and enforcing mode)?
Your answer is: t
----------
the_most_suitable LSM SELinux does 
not support
----------
The default LSM AppArmor does 
support1 point
----------------------------------------
3. Want LSM to support fine tuning policy based on log? [T/F]
Description: LSM provides features that allow users to fine-tune access permissions (e.g. aa-logprof from AppArmor, audit2allow form selinux)
Your answer is: t
----------
the_most_suitable LSM SELinux does 
support and get 1 point
----------
The default LSM AppArmor does 
support1 point
----------------------------------------
4. Want LSM to be able to support dynamically load policy? [T/F]
Description: Load or use new policy without reboot
Your answer is: t
----------
the_most_suitable LSM SELinux does 
support and get 1 point
----------
The default LSM AppArmor does 
support1 point
----------------------------------------
5. Want LSM to support caches? [T/F]
Description: Recording the access behavior through the cache can speed up the confirmation of access rights. In addition, the access behavior of the same object and subject 
usually occurs multiple times in a short period of time, so the caching mechanism can greatly speed up the confirmation speed of access rights.
