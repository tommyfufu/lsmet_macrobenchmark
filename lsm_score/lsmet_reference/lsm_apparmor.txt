I. Introduction of AppArmor
    AppArmor, Application Armor, is an application-centric MAC framework built using LSM. Apparmor confines individual programs to a set of files, 
    capabilities, network access and rlimits, collectively known as the AppArmor policy for the program, or simply as a profile.
    Application field: Suitable for managing a single program, such as PC, Server

II. Introduction of minor Linux Security Module (can coexist with other LSMs)
1. Capabilities
    The LSM kernel patch moves most of the existing POSIX.1e capabilities logic into an optional security module stored in the file security/capability.c. 
    This change allows users who do not want to use capabilities to omit this code entirely from their kernel, 
    instead using the dummy module for traditional superuser logic or any other module that they desire. 
    This change also allows the developers of the capabilities logic to maintain and enhance their code more freely, without needing to integrate patches back into the base kernel.
2. Lockdown
    The Kernel Lockdown feature is designed to prevent both direct and indirect access to a running kernel image, attempting to protect against unauthorized modification of 
    the kernel image and to prevent access to security and cryptographic data located in kernel memory, whilst still permitting driver modules to be loaded.
3. Yama
    Yama is a Linux Security Module that collects system-wide DAC security protections that are not handled by the core kernel itself. 
    This is selectable at build-time with CONFIG_SECURITY_YAMA, and can be controlled at run-time through sysctls in /proc/sys/kernel/yama
4. LoadPin
    LoadPin is a Linux Security Module that ensures all kernel-loaded files (modules, firmware, etc) all originate from the same filesystem, 
    with the expectation that such a filesystem is backed by a read-only device such as dm-verity or CDROM. 
    This allows systems that have a verified and/or unchangeable filesystem to enforce module and firmware loading restrictions without needing to sign the files individually.
5. SafeSetID
    SafeSetID is an LSM module that gates the setid family of syscalls to restrict UID/GID transitions from a given UID/GID to only those approved by a system-wide allowlist. 
    These restrictions also prohibit the given UIDs/GIDs from obtaining auxiliary privileges associated with CAP_SET{U/G}ID, such as allowing a user to set up user namespace 
    UID/GID mappings.

III. How to install AppArmor on your distribution
Alpine:
    Because Alpine kernel does not have apparmor inserted, you need to remake the kernel with apparmor
    Alpine How To Make Custom Kernel reference website: https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Custom_Kernel

    Alpine Linux packages (apk) main repository doesn't not provide AppArmor tools, there is two solutions
    1. Add repositories into /etc/apk/repositories, for example, # echo http://alpine.ccns.nck.edu.tw/alpine/edge/testing >> /etc/apk/repositories
    2. Download tool packages from Apparmor official website, https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor 
centOS:
    Because centOS kernel does not have apparmor inserted, you need to remake the kernel with apparmor
    centOS How To Make Kernel: https://www.tecmint.com/compile-linux-kernel-on-centos-7/
    
    centOS packages (yum) (rpk) main repository doesn't not provide AppArmor tools, there is one solutions
    1. Download tool packages from Apparmor official website, https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor 
Ubuntu:
    Description: AppArmor is the default LSM of Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions , you can use apt or apt-get to install apparmor-utils (some managing tools), 
    and apparmor-profile (profiles of some common applications, such as apache, ping)

IV. Questionnaire analysis
Listing each question and AppArmor answer

/----------------------------------------/
Class 1 - Trivial questions 
/----------------------------------------/
----------------------------------------
1. Want LSM has default policy? [T/F]
Description: LSM provides default policy
Ans: No
Note: Apparmor does not support defulat policy, but official AppArmor has some profiles for several common apps

----------------------------------------
2. Want LSM to suppor Automatically generate policies? [T/F]
Description: LSM provides the ability to automatically generate policies (i.e. learning mode and enforcing mode)?
Ans: Yes
Note: Apparmor provides aa-genprof tool

----------------------------------------
3. Want LSM to support fine tuning policy based on log? [T/F]
Description: LSM provides features that allow users to fine-tune access permissions (e.g. aa-logprof from AppArmor, audit2allow form selinux)
Ans: Yes

----------------------------------------
4. Want LSM to be able to support dynamically load policy? [T/F]
Description: Load or use new policy without reboot
Ans: Yes
----------------------------------------
5. Want LSM to support caches? [T/F]
Description: Recording the access behavior through the cache can speed up the confirmation of access rights. In addition, the access behavior of the same object and subject 
usually occurs multiple times in a short period of time, so the caching mechanism can greatly speed up the confirmation speed of access rights.
Ans: No

----------------------------------------
6. Want LSM to support security auditing? [T/F]
Description: Provides additional auditing capabilities
Ans: Yes

----------------------------------------
7. Want LSM to supports configurable audit? [T/F]
Description: Auditing can be tuned for more fine-grained record access behavior
Ans: No

----------------------------------------
8. Want LSM to support whitelist? [T/F]
Description: Provides a whitelist function to comply with the principle of least privilege as much as possible
Ans: No
Note: For applications, a profile is equivalent to a whitelist; however, AppArmor is not sufficient from a system perspective

----------------------------------------
9. Want LSM to support trust path execution? [T/F]
Description: Provides Path Trust Execution (PTE) functionality to revoke a program's permission to use system calls (e.g. exec())
Ans: No

----------------------------------------
10. Want LSM to support sandbox? [T/F]
Description: LSM can assist in establishing a sandbox environment
Ans: No

----------------------------------------
11. Want LSM to have security certifications? [T/F]
Description: Such as passing CAPP, EAL, LSPP and other security verification
Ans: No

----------------------------------------
12. Want LSM to support memory protection? [T/F]
Description: LSM can shield important program and/or kernel structures from tampering via memory interfaces such as mmap(2), /dev/kmem, or even via stack overruns
Ans: No

************************************************
/----------------------------------------/

Description: Domain Type Enforcement (DTE), The Flux Advanced Security Kernel (FLASK), Multi-level Security (MLS), Role-based access control (RBAC)
Ans: AppArmor does not support any of options

----------------------------------------
2. Which virtualization technique do you want to support? [0]none [1]Docker [2]KVM [3]libvirt [4]QEMU [5]sVirt [6]Xen
Description: LSM official website provides security support for specific virtualization technologies
Ans: AppArmor supports [1]Docker [2]KVM [3]libvirt [4]QEMU
