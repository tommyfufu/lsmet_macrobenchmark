I. Introduction of SELinux
    SELinux is a security enhancement to Linux which allows users and administrators more control over access control.
    Access can be constrained on such variables as which users and applications can access which resources. 
    These resources may take the form of files. Standard Linux access controls, such as file modes (-rwxr-xr-x) are modifiable by the user and the applications which the user runs. 
    Conversely, SELinux access controls are determined by a policy loaded on the system which may not be changed by careless users or misbehaving applications.
    SELinux also adds finer granularity to access controls. Instead of only being able to specify who can read, write or execute a file, 
    for example, SELinux lets you specify who can unlink, append only, move a file and so on. 
    SELinux allows you to specify access to many resources other than files as well, such as network resources and interprocess communication (IPC).

II. Introduction of minor Linux Security Module (can coexist with other LSMs)
1. Capabilities
    The LSM kernel patch moves most of the existing POSIX.1e capabilities logic into an optional security module stored in the file security/capability.c. 
    This change allows users who do not want to use capabilities to omit this code entirely from their kernel, 
    instead using the dummy module for traditional superuser logic or any other module that they desire. 
    This change also allows the developers of the capabilities logic to maintain and enhance their code more freely, without needing to integrate patches back into the base kernel.
2. Lockdown
    The Kernel Lockdown feature is designed to prevent both direct and indirect access to a running kernel image, attempting to protect against unauthorized modification of 
    the kernel image and to prevent access to security and cryptographic data located in kernel memory, whilst still permitting driver modules to be loaded.
3. Yama
    Yama is a Linux Security Module that collects system-wide DAC security protections that are not handled by the core kernel itself. 
    This is selectable at build-time with CONFIG_SECURITY_YAMA, and can be controlled at run-time through sysctls in /proc/sys/kernel/yama
4. LoadPin
    LoadPin is a Linux Security Module that ensures all kernel-loaded files (modules, firmware, etc) all originate from the same filesystem, 
    with the expectation that such a filesystem is backed by a read-only device such as dm-verity or CDROM. 
    This allows systems that have a verified and/or unchangeable filesystem to enforce module and firmware loading restrictions without needing to sign the files individually.
5. SafeSetID
    SafeSetID is an LSM module that gates the setid family of syscalls to restrict UID/GID transitions from a given UID/GID to only those approved by a system-wide allowlist. 
    These restrictions also prohibit the given UIDs/GIDs from obtaining auxiliary privileges associated with CAP_SET{U/G}ID, such as allowing a user to set up user namespace 
    UID/GID mappings.

III. How to install SELinux on your distribution
Alpine:
    Because Alpine kernel does not have SELinux inserted, you need to remake the kernel with SELinux
    Alpine How To Make Custom Kernel reference website: https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Custom_Kernel

    Alpine Linux packages (apk) main repository doesn't not provide SE-Tools, there is one solution
    1. reference: https://github.com/SELinuxProject/setools
centOS:
    SELinux is the default LSM of Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions , you can use yum or rpm to install setools (some managing tools)
    
Ubuntu:
    Ubuntu does have SELinux inserted, so you don't need to remake the kernel with SELinux, just need to disable AppArmor, and then enable SELinux
    reference: http://www.selinuxproject.org/page/Guide/Installation
    you can use apt or apt-get to install selinux dependencies, such as se-tools (some managing tools)

IV. Questionnaire analysis
Listing each question and SELinux answer

/----------------------------------------/
Class 1 - Trivial questions 
/----------------------------------------/
----------------------------------------
1. Want LSM has default policy? [T/F]
Description: LSM provides default policy
Ans: Yes
Note: SELinux provides two policies, one is target (as default policy for most situation) and the other is MLS.

----------------------------------------
2. Want LSM to suppor Automatically generate policies? [T/F]
Description: LSM provides the ability to automatically generate policies (i.e. learning mode and enforcing mode)?
Ans: Yes
Note: SELinux provides audit2allow tool

----------------------------------------
3. Want LSM to support fine tuning policy based on log? [T/F]
Description: LSM provides features that allow users to fine-tune access permissions (e.g. aa-logprof from AppArmor, audit2allow form selinux)
Ans: Yes
Note: audit2allow

----------------------------------------
4. Want LSM to be able to support dynamically load policy? [T/F]
Description: Load or use new policy without reboot
Ans: No.

----------------------------------------
5. Want LSM to support caches? [T/F]
Description: Recording the access behavior through the cache can speed up the confirmation of access rights. In addition, the access behavior of the same object and subject 
usually occurs multiple times in a short period of time, so the caching mechanism can greatly speed up the confirmation speed of access rights.
Ans: Yes
Note: One of the features of SELinux

----------------------------------------
6. Want LSM to support security auditing? [T/F]
Description: Provides additional auditing capabilities
Ans: Yes

----------------------------------------
7. Want LSM to supports configurable audit? [T/F]
Description: Auditing can be tuned for more fine-grained record access behavior
Ans: Yes

----------------------------------------
8. Want LSM to support whitelist? [T/F]
Description: Provides a whitelist function to comply with the principle of least privilege as much as possible
Ans: Yes

----------------------------------------
9. Want LSM to support trust path execution? [T/F]
Description: Provides Path Trust Execution (PTE) functionality to revoke a program's permission to use system calls (e.g. exec())
Ans: Yes

----------------------------------------
10. Want LSM to support sandbox? [T/F]
Description: LSM can assist in establishing a sandbox environment
Ans: Yes

----------------------------------------
11. Want LSM to have security certifications? [T/F]
Description: Such as passing CAPP, EAL, LSPP and other security verification
Ans: Yes

----------------------------------------
12. Want LSM to support memory protection? [T/F]
Description: LSM can shield important program and/or kernel structures from tampering via memory interfaces such as mmap(2), /dev/kmem, or even via stack overruns
Ans: Yes
